Follow these directions to download the GEOS-Chem Classic source code.

.. _get-code-steps-clone-gcclassic:

====================================
Clone GCClassic and fetch submodules
====================================

To download the latest stable GEOS-Chem Classic version), type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git

This command does the following:

#. Clones the :ref:`GCClassic <get-code-repos-gcclassic>` repo from
   GitHub to a local folder named :file:`GCClassic`;
#. Clones the :ref:`GEOS-Chem Science Codebase <get-code-repos-gc>`
   repo from GitHub to :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`; and
#. Clones the :ref:`HEMCO <get-code-repos-hemco>` repo from GitHub to :file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`.

.. tip::

   To download GEOS-Chem Classic source code into a folder named
   something other than :file:`GCClassic`, supply the name of the
   folder at the end of the :command:`git clone` command.  For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git my-code-dir

   will download the GEOS-Chem Classic source code into
   :file:`my-code-dir` instead of :file:`GCClassic`.
      
Once the :command:`git clone` process starts, you should see output
similar to this:

When the :command:`git clone` process has finished, navigate into the
:file:`GCClassic` folder and get a directory listing:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd GCClassic
   $ ls -CF src/*

and you will see output similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

   src/CMakeLists.txt  src/gc_classic_version.H@  src/main.F90@

   src/GEOS-Chem:
   APM/            CMakeScripts/  GeosUtil/  History/     lib/         ObsPack/   run/
   AUTHORS.txt     doc/           GTMM/      Interfaces/  LICENSE.txt  PKUCPL/
   bin/            GeosCore/      Headers/   ISORROPIA/   mod/         README.md

   src/HEMCO:
   AUTHORS.txt  CMakeLists.txt  CMakeScripts/  LICENSE.txt  README.md  run/  src/

This confirms that the :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem` and
:file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO` folders have been populated with source
code from the :ref:`GEOS-Chem Science Codebase <get-code-repos-gc>`
and :ref:`HEMCO <get-code-repos-hemco>` GitHub repositories.

.. _get-code-steps-branch:

==============================================
Create a branch in src/GEOS-Chem for your work
==============================================

Whter the :program:`git clone` command :ref:`described above
<get-code-steps-clone-gcclassic>` finishes, the :ref:`GEOS-Chem
Science Codebase <get-code-repos-gc>` submodule code (in folder
:file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`) and the :ref:`HEMCO
<get-code-repos-hemco>` submodule code (in folder
:file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`) will be in **detached HEAD state**. In
other words, the code is checked out but a branch is not
created. Adding new code to a detached HEAD state is very dangerous
and should be avoided. You should instead make a branch it the same
point as the detached HEAD, and then add your own modifications into
that branch.

Navigate from :file:`GCClassic` to :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd src/GEOS-Chem

and then type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git branch

You will see output similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

    *(HEAD detached at xxxxxxxx)
    main

where ``xxxxxxxx`` denotes the hash of the commit at which the code
has been checked out.

At ths point, you may now create a branch in which to store your own
modifications to the GEOS-Chem science codebase.  Type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git branch feature/my-git-updates
   $ git checkout feature/my-git-updates

.. note::

   This naming convention adheres to the
   `Github Flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_
   conventions (i.e. new feature branches start with
   :file:`feature/`, bug fix branches start with :file:`bugfix/`, etc.

Instead of :file:`feature/my-git-updates`, you may choose a name that reflects
the nature of your updates (e.g. :file:`feature/new_reactions`, etc.)  If
you now type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git branch

You will see that we are checked out onto the branch that you just
created and are no longer in detached HEAD state.

.. code-block:: text

   * feature/my-git-updates
   main

At this point, you may proceed to add your modifications into the
GEOS-Chem Science Codebase.

.. note::

   If you need to also modify :ref:`HEMCO <get-code-repos-hemco>`
   source code, repeat the process above to create your own working
   branch in :file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`.
