==========================================================
Do I need a HEMCO restart file for my initial spin-up run?
==========================================================

Using a HEMCO restart file for your initial spin up run is
optional. The HEMCO restart file contains fields for initializing
variables required for Soil NOx emissions, MEGAN biogenic emissions,
and the UCX chemistry quantities. The HEMCO restart file that comes
with a run directory may only be used for the date and time indicated
in the filename. HEMCO will automatically recognize when a restart
file is not available for the date and time required, and in that case
HEMCO will use default values to initialize those fields. You can also
force HEMCO to use the default initialization values by setting
:code:`HEMCO_RESTART` to false in :file:`HEMCO_Config.rc`.
