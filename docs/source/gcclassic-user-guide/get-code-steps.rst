Follow these directions to download the GEOS-Chem Classic source code.

.. _get-code-steps-clone-gcclassic:

====================================
Clone GCClassic and fetch submodules
====================================

To download the latest stable GEOS-Chem Classic version, type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git

This command does the following:

#. Clones the :ref:`GCClassic <get-code-repos-gcclassic>` repo from
   GitHub to a local folder named :file:`GCClassic`;
#. Clones the :ref:`get-code-repos-gc-sci`
   repo from GitHub to :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`;
#. Clones the :ref:`get-code-repos-hemco` repo from GitHub to
   :file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`;
#. Clones the :ref:`get-code-repos-other-cloudj` repo from GitHub to
   :file:`GCClassic/src/Cloud-J`;
#. Clones the :ref:`get-code-repos-other-hetp` repo from GitHub to
   :file:`GCClassic/src/HETP`; and
#. Clones the :ref:`get-code-repos-other-docs` from GitHub to
   :file:`GCClassic/docs/source/geos-chem-shared-docs`.

.. tip::

   To download GEOS-Chem Classic source code into a folder named
   something other than :file:`GCClassic`, supply the name of the
   folder at the end of the :command:`git clone` command.  For example:

   .. code-block:: console

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git my-code-dir

   will download the GEOS-Chem Classic source code into
   :file:`my-code-dir` instead of :file:`GCClassic`.

Once the :command:`git clone` process starts, you should see output
similar to this:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/geoschem/GCClassic.git

When the :command:`git clone` process has finished, navigate into the
:file:`GCClassic` folder and get a directory listing:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd GCClassic
   $ ls -CF src/*
   src/CMakeLists.txt

   src/Cloud-J:

This confirms that the :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem` and
:file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO` folders have been populated with source
code from the GitHub repositories listed above.

.. tip::

   To use an older GEOS-Chem Classic version (e.g. 14.0.0), follow
   these additional steps:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git checkout tags/14.0.0                  # Points HEAD to the tag "14.0.0"
      $ git branch version_14.0.0                 # Creates a new branch at tag "14.0.0"
      $ git checkout version_14.0.0               # Checks out the version_14.0.0 branch
      $ git submodule update --init --recursive   # Reverts submodules to the "14.0.0" tag

   You can do this for any tag in the version history.   For a list of
   all tags, type:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git tag

   If you have any unsaved  changes, make sure you commit those to a
   branch prior to updating versions.

.. _get-code-steps-branch:

==============================================
Create a branch in src/GEOS-Chem for your work
==============================================

Whter the :program:`git clone` command :ref:`described above
<get-code-steps-clone-gcclassic>` finishes, the :ref:`GEOS-Chem
Science Codebase <get-code-repos-gc>` submodule code (in folder
:file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`) and the :ref:`HEMCO
<get-code-repos-hemco>` submodule code (in folder
:file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`) will be in **detached HEAD state**. In
other words, the code is checked out but a branch is not
created. Adding new code to a detached HEAD state is very dangerous
and should be avoided. You should instead make a branch it the same
point as the detached HEAD, and then add your own modifications into
that branch.

Navigate from :file:`GCClassic` to :file:`GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd src/GEOS-Chem

and then type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git branch

You will see output similar to this:

.. code-block:: text

    *(HEAD detached at xxxxxxxx)
    main

where ``xxxxxxxx`` denotes the hash of the commit at which the code
has been checked out.

At ths point, you may now create a branch in which to store your own
modifications to the GEOS-Chem science codebase.  Type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git branch feature/my-git-updates
   $ git checkout feature/my-git-updates

Instead of :file:`feature/my-git-updates`, you may choose a name that reflects
the nature of your updates (e.g. :file:`feature/new_reactions`, etc.).

.. note::

   This naming convention adheres to the `Github Flow
   <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_
   conventions (i.e. new feature branches start with
   :file:`feature/`, bug fix branches start with :file:`bugfix/`, etc.

If you now type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git branch

You will see that we are checked out onto the branch that you just
created and are no longer in detached HEAD state.

.. code-block:: text

   * feature/my-git-updates
   main

At this point, you may proceed to add your modifications into the
GEOS-Chem Science Codebase.

.. note::

   If you need to also modify :ref:`HEMCO <get-code-repos-hemco>`
   source code, repeat the process above to create your own working
   branch in :file:`GCClassic/src/HEMCO`.
