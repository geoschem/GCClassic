Photolysis and chemistry configuration files
############################################

.. note::

   You won't need to edit these configuration files unless you are
   changing the photolysis and/or chemistry mechanisms used in your
   GEOS-Chem Classic simulation.

==============================
Photolysis configuration files
==============================

These are found in the ``ExtData/CHEM_INPUTS/FAST_JX/`` directory
structure. Please see `Input files for FAST-JX
v7.0 <FAST-JX_v7.0_photolysis_mechanism#Input_files_for_FAST-JX_v7.0>`__
for details.

.. _cfg-phot-chem-chem:

======================================
Chemical mechanism configuration files
======================================

GEOS-Chem Classic simulations use source code generated by `The
Kinetic PreProcessor <https://github.com/KineticPreProcessor/KPP>`_.
If you need to update the default chemistry mechanism, you will need 
to do the following steps:

#. Modify the relevant KPP configuration files (described below);
#. Run KPP to generate updated source code for GEOS-Chem Classic;
#. :ref:`Compile GEOS-Chem Classic <compile>` to create a new
   executable;
#. Start your GEOS-Chem Classic simulation.

Chemical mechanism configuration files are located in these folders:

.. option:: KPP/fullchem

   Contains configuration files for the default "full-chemistry"
   mechanism (NOx + Ox + aerosols + Br + Cl + I).

   - :file:`fullchem.kpp`: Main configuration file for the
     **fullchem** mechanism.

   - :file:`fullchem.eqn`: List of species and reactions
     for the **fullchem** mechanism.

.. option:: KPP/Hg

   Contains configuration files for the mercury chemistry mechanism:

   - :file:`Hg.kpp`: Main configuration file for the **Hg**
     mechanism.

   - :file:`Hg.eqn`: List of species and reactions for the **Hg**
     mechanism.

.. option:: KPP/custom

   Contains configuration files that you can edit if you need to
   create a custom mechanism.   We recommend that you create the
   custom in this folder and leave :file:`KPP/fullchem` and
   :file:`KPP/Hg` untouched.

   - :file:`custom.kpp`: Copy of :file:`fullchem.kpp`

   - :file:`custom.eqn`: Copy of :file:`fullchem.eqn`.
