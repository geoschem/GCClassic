We invite you to watch our  `Getting Started with GEOS-Chem 13.0.0
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV4BIj8WAxE&t=5s>`_ video tutorial
(presented by GEOS-Chem Support Team member Melissa Sulprizio) for a
quick overview of how to download, compile, and run
:program:`GEOS-Chem Classic`.

.. note::

   Even though this video demonstrates how to get started using
   the :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic 13.0.0` release, you can follow the
   same steps for any subsequent GEOS-Chem version.

   When this video was made, the GEOS-Chem
   manual was located on the `GEOS-Chem wiki
   <http://wiki.geos-chem.org>`_, and you will see references
   being made to the wiki documentation.

   We have since migrated much of the technical information for
   :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` to this ReadTheDocs site. Scientific
   documentation for GEOS-Chem may still be found on the  GEOS-Chem wiki.
