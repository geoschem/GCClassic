Download data with a dry-run simulation

.. tip::

   If you are located at an institution with many other GEOS-Chem
   users, then the :ref:`necessary input data <input-overview>` might
   have already been downloaded and stored in a commmon directory on
   your system.  Ask your sysadmin or IT support staff.

.. tip::

   Another way to download and manage GEOS-Chem input data is with the
   :ref:`bashdatacatalog <bashdatacatalog>` tool.

A "dry-run" is a is a :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` simulation that
steps through time, but does not perform computations or read data
files from disk. Instead, a dry-run simulation prints a list of all
data files that a regular GEOS-Chem simulation would have read. The
dry-run output also denotes whether each data file was found on disk,
or if it is missing. This output can be fed to a script which will
download the missing data files to your computer system.

You may generate dry-run output for any of the GEOS-Chem Classic
simulation types (:option:`fullchem`, :option:`CH4`,
:option:`TransportTracers`, etc.)

In the following chapters, you will learn how to you can download data
using the output from a dry-run simulation:
