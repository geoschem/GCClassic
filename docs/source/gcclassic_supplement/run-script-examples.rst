Sample GEOS-Chem run scripts
============================

Here are some sample run scripts that you can adapt for your own purposes.

.. _run-script-for-slurm-scheduler:

For clusters using the Slurm scheduler
--------------------------------------

Here is a sample GEOS-Chem run script for computational clusters that
use the Slurm scheduler to control jobs:

Run script for Slurm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save this code to a file named :file:`geoschem.run.slurm`:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    #SBATCH -c 24
    #SBATCH -N 1
    #SBATCH -t 0-12:00
    #SBATCH -p my-queue_name
    #SBATCH --mem=30000
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END

    ###############################################################################
    ### Sample GEOS-Chem run script for SLURM
    ### You can increase the number of cores with -c and memory with --mem,
    ### particularly if you are running at very fine resolution (e.g. nested-grid)
    ###############################################################################

    # Load your bash-shell customizations
    source ~/.bashrc

    # Load software modules
    # (this example is for GNU 10.2.0 compilers)
    source ~/gcclassic.gnu10.env

    # Set the proper # of threads for OpenMP
    # SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK ensures this matches the number you set with -c above
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK

    # Run GEOS_Chem.  The "time" command will return CPU and wall times.
    # Stdout and stderr will be directed to the "GC.log" log file
    # (you can change the log file name below if you wish)
    srun -c $OMP_NUM_THREADS time -p ./gcclassic >> GC.log

.. important:: If you forget to define :envvar:`OMP_NUM_THREADS` in
	       your run script, then :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` will
	       execute using one core.  This can cause your
	       simulations to take much longer than is necessary!

Then make :file:`geoschem.run.slurm` executable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ chmod 755 geoschem.run.slurm

For more information about how Slurm is set up on your particular
cluster, ask your sysadmin.

Submitting jobs with Slurm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To schedule a :program:`GEOS-Chem Classic` job with Slurm, use this
command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sbatch geoschem.run.slurm

.. _run-script-for-the-amazon-web-services-cloud:

For Amazon Web Services EC2 cloud instances
-------------------------------------------

When you log into an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance, you will
receive an entire node with as many **vCPUs** as you have requested. A
vCPU is equivalent to the number of computational cores. Most cloud
instances have twice as many vCPUs as physical CPUs (i.e. each CPU chip
has 2 cores).

.. tip:: To find out how many vCPUs are available in your instance,
	 you can use then :command:`nproc` command.

Run script for Amazon EC2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Save the code below to a file named :file:`geoschem.run.aws`:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    ###############################################################################
    ### Sample GEOS-Chem run script for Amazon Web Services EC2 instances
    ###############################################################################

    # Load your bash-shell customizations
    source ~/.bashrc

    ### NOTE: We do not have to load an environment file
    ### because all libraries are contained in the Amazon
    ### Machine Image (AMI) used to initialize the instance.

    # In an AWS cloud instance, you own the entire node, so there is no need
    # to use a scheduler like SLURM.  You can just use the `nproc` command
    # to specify the number of cores that GEOS-Chem should use.
    exportÂ OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc)

    # Run GEOS_Chem.  The "time" command will return CPU and wall times.
    # Stdout and stderr will be directed to the "GC.log" log file
    # (you can change the log file name below if you wish)
    time -p ./gcclassic >> GC.log 2>&1

And then make the :file:`geoschem.run.aws` file executable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ chmod 755 geoschem.run.aws

Running jobs on AWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you are on an AWS EC2 instance, you own the entire node, so it is
not necessary to use a scheduler.  You can run your GEOS-Chem job in
with this command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./geoschem.run.aws &

This will run your job in the background and send all output
(i.e. program output and error output) to :file:`log`.
